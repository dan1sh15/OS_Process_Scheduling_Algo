## Operating System Process Scheduling Algorithms
*These algorithms are implemented using various data structures from scratch*
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Longest Job First (LJF)
3. Shortest Job First (SJF)
4. Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
5. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
6. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
7. Priority Non Preemptive
8. Prioirty Preempive
9. Round Robin

### to execute the program use `g++ -o "filename" filename.cpp`
